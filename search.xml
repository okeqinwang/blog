Knowing what type of prayer to pray and when to pray it is very important to our prayer life.</p><p>In practice, we all use different types of prayer during our prayer times, and there is no reason why we cannot apply any of these types of prayers to all the situations that face us. Ask God to fill you with more of His love and make your prayer life richer.</p><h2 id="Prayer-of-Supplication"><a href="#Prayer-of-Supplication" class="headerlink" title="Prayer of Supplication"></a>Prayer of Supplication</h2><p>Luke 11:9-13; James 5:17-18; 1 Kings 8:37-40; 1 Kings 8:54-55</p><p>Supplication means to petition or entreat someone for something. A passionate zeal and hunger fuels the prayer of supplication. Prayers of supplication are prayers that all Christians should regularly engage in, as we earnestly desire to seek God’s face and know His will for our life. Ask God to give you a hunger for Him.</p><p><img src="/blog/assets/rugby_vbwc8u.jpg" alt="Intercession"></p><p><a href="https://pixnio.com/sport/rugby/rugby-sport-man-helmet-uniform-bench-prayer-grass-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Untitled</a> | <a href="https://pixnio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIXNIO</a></p><h2 id="Prayer-of-Intercession"><a href="#Prayer-of-Intercession" class="headerlink" title="Prayer of Intercession"></a>Prayer of Intercession</h2><p>Genesis 18:22-33 (Abraham); 1 Kings 18:41-46 (Elijah); 2 Kings 4:32-36 (Elisha); Acts 12:1-18 (The early church)</p><p>To intercede means to plead or mediate on behalf of another person. Intercessory prayer means praying earnestly for the needs of others, and seeking God’s will for their life. We are called to intercede for others, just as Jesus is interceding for us (Hebrews 7: 25).</p><h3 id="Six-Essentials-of-Effective-Intercessory-Prayer"><a href="#Six-Essentials-of-Effective-Intercessory-Prayer" class="headerlink" title="Six Essentials of Effective Intercessory Prayer"></a>Six Essentials of Effective Intercessory Prayer</h3><ul><li><em>Be Sincere</em><br>Prayer is a sacred responsibility, and we need to treat it as such. Samuel told the Israelites, “Far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by failing to pray for you.” (1 Samuel 12:23)</li><li><em>Be Discreet</em><br>If you’ve ever had details of your personal life spread all over church, you know how devastating a little gossip can be. Here’s a simple rule for any effective intercessor. Assume every prayer request offered by a friend is for your ears only, even if they don’t specifically say so. If you belong to a prayer group, you might ask the person if they mind you sharing their request so others can pray, too. Even if they respond positively, refrain from telling the group any more than is necessary.</li><li><em>Be Sensitive</em><br>Often, when people have just suffered a traumatic event, they’re exhausted with having to retell their story to every person who asks. While we want to demonstrate concern for others, there’s no reason to make them relive the ordeal by asking a lot of questions. All we really need to do is let them know we love them, and we’re praying.</li><li><em>Be Encouraging</em><br>An encouraging card or a sympathetic whisper promising to pray for someone in pain can brighten a dreary day and lift a weary heart. A simple expression of concern can be an incredible source of encouragement to anyone going through a physical, spiritual, or emotional struggle. And through the week, when they become discouraged, they can remind themselves that “Someone is praying for me!”</li><li><em>Be Organised</em><br>So often we glibly promise to pray for someone — and we really mean it — but somehow we simply fail to do so. When you make a commitment to pray for someone, make a note of it. Amid the pressures of daily life, prayer often gets pushed to the back burner. The whispers of our conscience can be drowned by the screams of a hungry baby or the demands of a cranky boss. But no matter what your work schedule is, you can find time to pray.</li><li><em>Be Committed</em><br>If you consistently have trouble making time for prayer, find a partner and hold each other accountable. Even if you don’t have the time to pray together, just remind each other regularly of your commitment to pray. In promising to pray for someone, you’ve made a sacred commitment. It’s a solemn responsibility — with incredible rewards.</li></ul><p><img src="/blog/assets/table_tr11xn.jpg" alt="Prayer of Faith"></p><p><a href="https://flic.kr/p/Yi9ruf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘Prayer’</a> | <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/137346868@N04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar</a> | <a href="https://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickr</a></p><h2 id="Prayer-of-Faith"><a href="#Prayer-of-Faith" class="headerlink" title="Prayer of Faith"></a>Prayer of Faith</h2><p>Mark 11:12-14; Mark 11:20-25; Luke 7:1-10; James 5:13-18; Matthew 9:18-26; James 1:5-8</p><p>The prayer of faith is rooted in our confidence in God’s Word. When you are sure that what you are praying for is God’s will for you, the prayer of faith can be employed. The prayer of faith is knowing God’s will, praying it and receiving it from Him. Not forgiving and doubting are the two greatest hindrances to prayers of faith.</p><h2 id="Prayer-of-Agreement"><a href="#Prayer-of-Agreement" class="headerlink" title="Prayer of Agreement"></a>Prayer of Agreement</h2><p>Genesis 11:1-9; Matthew 18:19-20; Exodus 17:8-13; Psalm 133:1-3; Acts 4:23; Hebrews 10:24-25; Matthew 28:16-20</p><p>The prayer of agreement is when two or more people come together and agree with one another and with the Word of God that something specific will be done. When we stand together in unity — with one purpose, sharing a joint vision and trusting God’s Word to be fulfilled — God can work miracles.</p><h2 id="Prayer-of-Praise-and-Thanksgiving"><a href="#Prayer-of-Praise-and-Thanksgiving" class="headerlink" title="Prayer of Praise and Thanksgiving"></a>Prayer of Praise and Thanksgiving</h2><p>Psalm 100; Acts 16:16-34; Psalm 149:4-9; 1Thessalonians 5:15-19</p><p>Praise and worship brings us into the presence of God. Praising God in both the good and bad times affirms our faith in Him. Praise and thanksgiving are powerful weapons. They disarm the two most deadly weapons to our Christian walk: unbelief and satanic attacks. These two things are manifested in many different ways, but praise and thanksgiving is the two-edged sword that helps us fight against evil.</p><p><img src="/blog/assets/lighthouse_yvg0lo.jpg" alt="Prayer of Faith"></p><p><a href="https://flic.kr/p/XfAepu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘The Church of Almighty God’</a> | <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/153103713@N04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angela Xu</a> | <a href="https://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickr</a></p><h2 id="Prayer-of-Contemplation"><a href="#Prayer-of-Contemplation" class="headerlink" title="Prayer of Contemplation"></a>Prayer of Contemplation</h2><p>The following steps may help you build contemplation into your prayer life.</p><ul><li><em>Establish a time and a place</em><br>Establish a regular time and place to give God your undivided attention each day (not in the car or while doing the dishes!). Have everything you need: your Bible, a journal, a pen, etc., so you can move right into prayer.</li><li><em>Keep your purpose clear</em><br>Come to this time for the sole purpose of seeking God’s face. Keep this time for worship, meditation and listening for His voice. Intercession and supplication are for another time.</li><li><em>Be still and quiet</em><br>This is a difficult discipline and takes much practice. After acknowledging God’s presence, become still and quiet before Him. Relax your mind and breathe deeply, all the while thanking Him silently that He meets you in the stillness.</li><li><em>Meditate on Scripture</em><br>Unlike Eastern meditation, our goal is not to empty our mind, but to fill it with the revelation of God’s manifest presence. Read small portions of Scripture, asking God to reveal Himself to you. Wait on Him and listen for the Shepherd’s voice.</li><li><em>Journal your prayers</em><br>Write daily love letters to God that respond to the joy of being with Him. Chronicle what He seems to be saying to you in writing.</li><li><em>Prepare for wandering thoughts</em><br>Don’t worry if your mind wanders, especially at first. Jot down things you need to do later; then return your mind to seeking God’s face again.</li><li><em>Don’t fear drowsiness</em><br>It is no sin to fall asleep in the arms of God. Of course, if this becomes the norm, you may need to change your sleeping habits!</li><li><em>Infuse intercession with contemplation</em><br>Whenever the battle in prayer takes its toll, take a few minutes to contemplate the loveliness of Christ, rest in His arms and simply enjoy His presence. Then go back to the work of active prayer.</li></ul><p>By Tricia McCary Rhodes</p>]]></content>

Prayer should be as much a part of our daily routine as eating, drinking and sleeping. Spending time with God is essential for healthy spiritual growth and not an optional extra, yet many of us experience frustration knowing that our prayer life could be much more than it is. However, starting a regular prayer routine can be difficult.</p><p>Here are some suggestions on how to start your personal prayer life:</p><ol><li><em>Choose a designated daily time to meet with God.</em><br>Write it in your appointment book. Fix the time firmly in your mind. If your primary prayer time is not when you first get up in the morning, remember nonetheless to make contact with God first thing in the day. And make sure to set aside enough time.</li><li><em>Set a specific minimum amount of time for your daily appointment with God.</em><br>This may vary, depending upon your circumstances. At times it may increase — or emergencies may reduce it. On holidays, vacations, and days off, plan on spending extra time with God.</li><li><em>Choose a regular location where you can meet with God.</em><br>It may be your office, bedroom or garden. Select a place where interruptions can be kept to a minimum.</li></ol><p>By Kurt Johnson</p><p><img src="/blog/assets/red-dress_fz6jys.jpg" alt="How to Pray"></p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ABrC7X4_gLY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘Going to the river to pray’</a> | <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dianasimumpande" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diana Simumpande</a> | <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></p><h2 id="Prayer-Models"><a href="#Prayer-Models" class="headerlink" title="Prayer Models"></a>Prayer Models</h2><h3 id="The-Lord’s-Prayer"><a href="#The-Lord’s-Prayer" class="headerlink" title="The Lord’s Prayer"></a>The Lord’s Prayer</h3><p>Our Father in heaven,<br>Hallowed be your name,<br>Your kingdom come,<br>Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.<br>Give us today our daily bread.<br>Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.<br>Matthew 6:9-13</p><p><em>Our Father</em>: calls for respect (hallowed be Thy name).<br><em>Thy kingdom come</em>: pray that Jesus will come back soon.<br><em>Thy will be done</em>: pray that you will understand the importance of God doing His will through us rather than us leading ourselves.<br><em>Give us our daily bread</em>: acknowledge, ask and be thankful for the tangible things in life.<br><em>Forgiveness</em>: pray for forgiveness for your sins.

If you have never tried biblical meditation before, use the follow simple steps as a guide:<br>i. Take a word, verse or short passage of Scripture<br>ii. Read it slowly<br>iii. Pray, asking God to help you understand it and speak to you through it<br>iv. Read it again<br>v. Think about the word/verse/passage in detail - what do we learn about God? What do we learn about ourselves? Can we work it out in our lives?<br>vi. Write down what you have learnt</li><li><em>Be flexible</em> — listen to worship and teaching tapes or read a chapter of an inspiring Christian book to help you get in the right frame of mind. Read from a different version of the Bible. If you normally pray inwardly, pray out loud.</li><li>Try to set aside occasional longer times when you can really <em>soak in God’s presence</em>.</li><li><em>Write</em> a psalm</li><li><em>Memorise Scripture</em> — write a verse on a card then break it into small easily learned portions. Use it to encourage yourself when things are tough.</li><li>Go for a <em>Prayer Walk</em> — this can be an opportunity to praise God for His creation or in a town to pray through the streets, for businesses, schools etc.</li><li><em>Personalise Scripture</em> — insert your name and let God’s Word bless you; for starters try Psalm 23.</li><li><em>Pray with someone</em> — for shared encouragement and motivation.</li></ol><p>By Clare Blake, from “Woman Alive” June 2001</p><p><img src="/blog/assets/prayer-group_zfvt3x.jpg" alt="How to Pray"></p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gfes/25564780610/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘Small group prayer’</a> | <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gfes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portland Seminary</a> | <a href="https://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickr</a></p><h2 id="Encountering-God-in-Prayer"><a href="#Encountering-God-in-Prayer" class="headerlink" title="Encountering God in Prayer"></a>Encountering God in Prayer</h2><p>Here are some suggestions on how you can get to know God better through prayer.</p><ul><li>Ask the Father for the covering of the Holy Spirit bringing the presence of Jesus.</li><li>Claim the blood of Jesus over all sin.</li><li>Ask for angels to guard you, since He has promised.</li><li>Ask Him to make sure that no other influences or thoughts will be allowed to disturb, that He will protect.</li><li>Invite Jesus to search your life for a revelation of hidden sin. Allow Him to take you back to childhood if necessary. Take time to be attentive and listen.</li><li>As conviction comes to your mind of thoughts, acts, cherished “rights” such as anger, rebellion and resentment, or experiences that in the presence of the cross are sin, be specific, <em>call it sin, and ask for forgiveness</em>. Accept forgiveness and thank Him aloud. (Your ears need to hear your own voice expressing confidence and praise).</li><li>Ask for a deeper repentance. Since it is a gift, thank Him, whether you feel anything or not.</li><li>By your own free choice, tell your Heavenly Father you give Him permission to remove the sin and sense of guilt or condemnation that came with the sin. Let God know you are willing to allow Him to place the burden you have been carrying on the shoulders of His Son. <em>Accept</em> Jesus’ desire to release you from this guilt. Christ wants to do this for you. Be sure to <em>express thanks</em> aloud.</li><li><em>Ask</em> God what He has for you in exchange. What characteristic of Jesus is He waiting to give you? What gift of guidance or insight is He making available? <em>Take time</em> to be attentive and to listen.</li><li>Let God know you will accept His gift (whatever thought, word or picture He brings to your mind). Be sure to thank Him aloud.</li><li><em>Repeat</em> the process as desired. <em>Enjoy</em> His presence. <em>Praise</em> Him.</li><li>At the time you are accepting gifts from God, if He has just impressed you of specific instances of sin, you may want to ask what help He would have sent if you had turned to Him fully in that earlier moment of temptation. Or you may ask what Jesus would have done in your place. He may give you delightful insights.</li><li>You may want to ask Him at the final moments of this specific prayer if there is anything or anyone else He wants you to pray about or for, or if there are any particular instructions He wants to share with you, etc. Take time to be attentive and to listen.</li><li>Be sure to <em>praise Him aloud</em> as you end your time in prayer. You’ll want to. He’s a wonderful God, and a marvellous, generous, loving friend!</li></ul><p>By Juanita Kretschmar</p><p><img src="/blog/assets/under-tree_ll6gz0.jpg" alt="How to Pray"></p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ReEqHw2GyeI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Untitled</a> | <a href="https://unsplash.com/@benwhitephotography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben White</a> | <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></p><h2 id="Five-things-we-need-to-know-about-prayer"><a href="#Five-things-we-need-to-know-about-prayer" class="headerlink" title="Five things we need to know about prayer"></a>Five things we need to know about prayer</h2><ol><li><em>Prayer isn’t talking to the wall</em><br>When we pray, we’re communicating with a real person. We’re talking to Someone who hears and understands us. God feels the joy, the excitement, the sorrow or the pain we have at that moment. And He knows there are times when we won’t know what to say. That’s OK. We’re permitted to just rest in Him, to pray without words. Besides, true friends can be in each other’s company without talking.</li><li><em>Prayer is as important as breathing</em><br>Someone once said, “Prayer is as necessary for spiritual life as breath is for physical life”. It’s impossible to be an authentic Christian and not be a praying Christian. Within any successful relationship there needs to be communication. Imagine having special friends and deciding not to speak to them - the friendship and the relationship would deteriorate. Why would we want to have a second-rate relationship with God?</li><li><em>God’s available - our time, our space</em><br>Even if He may not like where we are, or what we’re doing, He’s still available and He never closes shop. He’s open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Even better, He home delivers. You can pray anytime, anywhere.</li><li><em>Allow for God’s wisdom</em><br>Answers to prayer depend on God’s wisdom and timing, not on us. We shouldn’t expect God to answer prayer exactly the way we want. When we were children there were times our parents told us we couldn’t have what we wanted. A good parent knows there are times to say No! and God, as the Best Parent, will sometimes say No! or Not yet! God is much wiser than we are. Allow Him to answer in the way He thinks best. And remember, His main concern is our salvation - that’s His higher priority.</li><li><em>Prayer makes a difference</em><br>Prayer makes a difference to us and to our lives. I feel at peace when I have a consistent prayer life. I begin to see a dimension beyond the here and now because I’m tapping into the Eternal One. The ultimate goal of a prayer life is to develop it to the stage where, beyond the time we set aside for prayer, it seems like a continuous conversations you break into throughout the day. That just has to make a difference.</li></ol><p><img src="/blog/assets/cap-bokeh_pwjxvm.jpg" alt="How to Pray"></p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/IbBMEnmlpbI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Untitled</a> | <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jhanks787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joshua Hanks</a> | <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></p><h2 id="When-you-feel-God-is-not-hearing-you"><a href="#When-you-feel-God-is-not-hearing-you" class="headerlink" title="When you feel God is not hearing you"></a>When you feel God is not hearing you</h2><p>We’re always going to be in trouble if we rely on our feelings as a test of our spiritual life. God works way beyond the feelings level. If feelings become the test, there are times when we feel kilometres from God. At other times we feel so close. We need to rely upon the knowledge we have.</p><ul><li>We know God moved heaven and earth to give us Jesus.</li><li>We know He has promised to be with us, even through the valley of the shadow of death.</li><li>We know He is constantly with us.</li><li>We know He hears and answers prayers. Romans 8:27-39 tells us nothing can come between us and the love of God, in Jesus.</li></ul><p><em>Our feelings may go up and down, but God is constant. Trust Him.</em></p>]]></content>
