        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Write-resume-principle-one-kiss"><a href="#Write-resume-principle-one-kiss" class="headerlink" title="Write resume principle one (kiss)"></a>Write resume principle one (kiss)</h1><p>Come on, everyone is very busy. How can I read more than one page of resume? This is not HR’s affectation, but fact. But don’t think that using a one page resume is just for HR service, which is actually helping yourself.</p><p>Think about it from a different perspective. If you have 15 experiences, some of them are particularly brilliant, others are more or less watery. So the question is, do you want your resume readers to see more of your Niubi Shanshan, or water pork? That’s what a one page resume means.</p><p>Every sentence in the resume should be carefully carved, but it should not be piled up, but keep it simple, stuck (kiss).</p><p>Because not everyone knows all kinds of professional terms, especially for students of science and engineering, they apply for more traditional business positions with their academic projects and resumes full of terms… I can’t bear to say the consequences… The resume was first published.</p><p>Many people will regard it as their own child and can not be criticized at all. But in order to offer, we need to look for more people and revise them again and again.</p><p>Less is more</p><p>Less is more - of course, a good resume can help you stand out in the resume series, but when it comes to the interview, you should let the interviewer turn their attention from the resume to you.</p><p>From this point of view, you will know what kind of artifact a concise and focused resume is!</p><h1 id="Principle-two-star"><a href="#Principle-two-star" class="headerlink" title="Principle two (star)"></a>Principle two (star)</h1><p>Use star principle to describe each bullet point. Star principles are: situation, task, action and result. For example: as Minister of outreach.</p><p>We need to raise funds for the association. In three months, we need to lead a team of five people to increase the sponsorship amount of the association from a million in 2014 to B million by contacting alumni and other methods (omitting 30 words).</p><p>Star is a cliche, but why are many people still not good at it? Because you don’t know the proportional distribution, it’s easy to lose focus on the experience described by star. Try to carve your star with S + T = 25-30% / a = 50% / r = 20-25%. Maybe it will be a surprise.</p><h1 id="Principle-three-PREP"><a href="#Principle-three-PREP" class="headerlink" title="Principle three (PREP)"></a>Principle three (PREP)</h1><p>According to human resource management theory, a person’s past behavior can best predict his / her future behavior. That’s why resumes are all about personal experience.</p><p>But in the interview process, the interviewer will also directly ask some subjective questions, such as:</p><p>Why do you think you are suitable for this job? At this time, how to match your relative objective experience with your ability, interest and potential?</p><p>At this point, you need prep. Prep is point, reason, example, and point.</p><p>Through prep, take the experience on the resume as e, support R and P - take the above questions as an example, you can answer as follows:</p><p>(P) I think I am very suitable for the job of management consultant.</p><p>(R) as an engineering student, I am very sensitive to logic and numbers, and I can bypass them and apply them to business.</p><p>(E) for example, when I was interning in M consulting company, I solved a problem… (refer to the bullet point of internship experience here)…</p><p>(P) so I think I’m very suitable for the job.</p><p>Don’t write “self-evaluation” on your resume: “I have strong communication ability…” And so on. Take a dose of prep, show yourself structurally, and let your interview… Past!</p>]]></content>

The middle way is beyond our imagination. If you only have good product thinking, but lack code implementation ability, you need to find a technician to assist you. Or if you are already comprehensive, you can skip the prototype directly, deduce it in your mind, and then start to roll it up. In fact, I strongly recommend that prototypes be displayed in front of us. After all, they are completely imagined in the brain, and it’s hard to think about them thoroughly. Moreover, The product prototype design is only the first step to start a pit.It’s a great honor for me to meet you here and share something that you probably know or don’t know, and that I know exactly.</p></blockquote><h1 id="0x2-Prototype-Design-Tool"><a href="#0x2-Prototype-Design-Tool" class="headerlink" title="0x2 Prototype Design Tool"></a>0x2 Prototype Design Tool</h1><ul><li>Flinto</li><li>Axure</li></ul><h1 id="0x3-Front-end-technology-selection（Hybrid-App）"><a href="#0x3-Front-end-technology-selection（Hybrid-App）" class="headerlink" title="0x3 Front-end technology selection（Hybrid App）"></a>0x3 Front-end technology selection（Hybrid App）</h1><ul><li>Vue</li><li>Uinapp</li><li>Weex</li><li>ReactNative</li><li>Element-UI | Ant-Design</li></ul><h1 id="0x4-Backstage-Science-and-Technology-Selection"><a href="#0x4-Backstage-Science-and-Technology-Selection" class="headerlink" title="0x4 Backstage Science and Technology Selection"></a>0x4 Backstage Science and Technology Selection</h1><ul><li>Basic framework: Java-SpringCloud | SpringBoot | Dubbo</li><li>Protocol selection : HTTP vs TCP</li><li>Selection of databases : SQL vs NOSQL (Mysql | Redis)</li><li>Auth Tickets: Session | OAuth | JWT</li><li>Message Queue: RocketMq</li><li>GateWay: Nginx | Openresty</li></ul><h1 id="0x5-Deployment-Automation"><a href="#0x5-Deployment-Automation" class="headerlink" title="0x5 Deployment Automation"></a>0x5 Deployment Automation</h1><ul><li>Jenkins | Ansible</li><li>Docker</li><li>Kubernetes</li></ul><h1 id="0x6-Code-Hosting"><a href="#0x6-Code-Hosting" class="headerlink" title="0x6 Code Hosting"></a>0x6 Code Hosting</h1><ul><li>Github</li><li>Gitlab | Gogs</li></ul><h1 id="0x7-Monitoring-amp-Visualization"><a href="#0x7-Monitoring-amp-Visualization" class="headerlink" title="0x7 Monitoring &amp; Visualization"></a>0x7 Monitoring &amp; Visualization</h1><ul><li>Cat</li><li>Prometheus</li><li>Pinpoint</li><li>E（Elasticsearch）L（Logstash）K（Kibana）, ELK</li><li>Grafana | Kibana can be combined with Proetheus to form monitoring data integration</li></ul><h1 id="0x8-Others-All-stack-developers-will-know"><a href="#0x8-Others-All-stack-developers-will-know" class="headerlink" title="0x8 Others .
